# Seed Studio XIAO RP2040 with NuttX(RTOS)
## Introduction

[NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/) NuttX is a mature real-time operating system (RTOS) widely recognized for its standards compliance and small footprint. One of NuttX's main features is its scalability, which allows it to be used in environments ranging from 8-bit microcontrollers to 64-bit systems. This flexibility is achieved through adherence to POSIX and ANSI standards, enabling you to experiment with similar NuttX features across a wide range of chips from different architectures, families, and semiconductor vendors.

Additionally, NuttX offers many advanced and useful features, such as USB, Ethernet, Audio, and Graphics subsystems. These characteristics make NuttX an attractive choice for developers seeking a versatile, robust RTOS capable of operating on various types of hardware.

NuttX supports a vast and continually expanding number of boards. [The official documentation](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/platforms/) provides a comprehensive list of supported boards, organized by architecture and System-on-Chip (SoC) series.

For instance, the [Seeed Studio Xiao RP2040](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/platforms/arm/rp2040/boards/seeed-xiao-rp2040/index.html) page in the NuttX documentation offers detailed descriptions of each supported feature and instructions on how to utilize them.

## Getting Started

The first step to get started with NuttX is to install a series of required tools, a toolchain for the architecture you will be working with and, finally, download NuttX source code itself.The Nuttx provides a [guide](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/quickstart/install.html) to different platforms.

After installing and setting up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Download Raspberry Pi Pico SDK:

```
git clone -b 1.1.2 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
```

3. Set PICO_SDK_PATH enviroment variable:

```
export PICO_SDK_PATH=<absolute_path_to_pico-sdk_directory>
```
2. Create a workspace

```
mkdir nuttxspace

```

3. Clone the repositories

```
cd nuttxspace
git clone https://github.com/apache/nuttx.git nuttx
git clone https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps apps

```

- Nuttx: contains implemented the kernel, driver and subsystems.
- Apps: it's a collection of tools, shells, network utilities, libraries, interpreters and can be used with the NuttX RTOS.

## Applications
