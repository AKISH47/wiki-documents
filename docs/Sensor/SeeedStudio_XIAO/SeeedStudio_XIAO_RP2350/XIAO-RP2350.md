## Contents Map

The XIAO RP2350 is one of the [XIAO series](/xiao_topic_page) members. This follow-along reading is organized as a `Contents Map` to guide you through a more dedicated and structured exploration. *This map is still growing, and contributions from the community are always welcome*.

Explore these sections to help you get started with the XIAO RP2350 and make the most of its features and capabilities:

### Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

In this page, we cover the basics of the XIAO RP2350's features, specifications, and potential applications in an easy-to-understand way.

- **[Setting Up the Pico SDK](/xiao-rp2350-c-cpp-sdk)**  
  The Pico SDK is your starting point for developing projects on the XIAO RP2350. This section explains what the SDK is and provides step-by-step setup instructions.
  <!-- - **[Exploring MicroPython](link)**  
  If you're familiar with Python, MicroPython is a great way to start coding on the XIAO RP2350. This section shows you how to use MicroPython and leverage your existing Python skills to quickly create projects. -->

### Let's Make It Blink! ‚ú®

Getting the board to blink an LED is often the first program everyone runs. The same goes for the XIAO RP2350. For those who want to blink with SDK programming and know how to set up the SDK development environment, check the page [Setting Up the Pico SDK](/xiao-rp2350-c-cpp-sdk).


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="MicroPython" default>

```python
from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT) # GPIO25 is for USER LED

while True:
    led.value(1)
    sleep(0.5)
    led.value(0)
    sleep(0.5)
```

### Battery & Power Management

Is it possible to read the battery voltage without extra components? Yes! We heard you. With more pins provided, the XIAO RP2350 makes it possible. For previous members of the XIAO family, such as the [XIAO ESP32C3](/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/#check-the-battery-voltage), reading the battery voltage level required manually connecting to *A0* with a resistor.

However, with the XIAO RP2350, this is no longer necessary. You can now use the `A3/GPIO29` pin to directly read the battery voltage level, simplifying your design and development process. Additionally, for battery level reading, the `GPIO19` must be set to a high value, which is the enable pin for reading the battery level.

Follow along with this code snippet to read the battery voltage using the Pico SDK:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="MicroPython" default>

```python
from machine import Pin, ADC
import time

# Function to initialize the GPIO pin for enabling battery voltage reading
def init_gpio():
    enable_pin = Pin(19, Pin.OUT)
    enable_pin.value(1)  # Set the pin to high to enable battery voltage reading

def main():
    print("ADC Battery Example - GPIO29 (A3)")
    
    init_gpio()  # Initialize the enable pin
    adc = ADC(Pin(29))  # Initialize the ADC on GPIO29

    conversion_factor = 3.3 / (1 << 12)  # Conversion factor for 12-bit ADC and 3.3V reference
    
    while True:
        result = adc.read_u16()  # Read the ADC value
        voltage = result * conversion_factor * 2  # Calculate the voltage, considering the voltage divider (factor of 2)
        print("Raw value: 0x{:03x}, voltage: {:.2f} V".format(result, voltage))
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Delay for 500 milliseconds

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

  <TabItem value="sdk" label="C/C++ SDK">

```c title='adc_bat.c'
#include <stdio.h>
#include "pico/stdlib.h"
#include "hardware/gpio.h"
#include "hardware/adc.h"

// Function to initialize the GPIO pin for enabling battery voltage reading
void init_gpio() {
    const int enable_pin = 19; // Pin to enable battery voltage reading

    gpio_init(enable_pin); // Initialize the pin
    gpio_set_dir(enable_pin, GPIO_OUT); // Set the pin as output
    gpio_put(enable_pin, 1); // Set the pin to high to enable battery voltage reading
}

int main() {
    stdio_init_all(); // Initialize standard input/output
    printf("ADC Battery Example - GPIO29 (A3)\n");

    init_gpio(); // Initialize the enable pin
    adc_init(); // Initialize the ADC

    // Initialize the ADC GPIO pin (GPIO29)
    adc_gpio_init(29);
    // Select ADC input 3 (corresponding to GPIO29)
    adc_select_input(3);

    while (1) {
        // 12-bit conversion, assume max value == ADC_VREF == 3.3 V
        const float conversion_factor = 3.3f / (1 << 12); // Conversion factor for 12-bit ADC and 3.3V reference
        uint16_t result = adc_read(); // Read the ADC value
        // Calculate the voltage, considering the voltage divider (factor of 2)
        printf("Raw value: 0x%03x, voltage: %f V\n", result, result * conversion_factor * 2); 
        sleep_ms(500); // Delay for 500 milliseconds
