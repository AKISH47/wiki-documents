## Introduction 

The Pico SDK is an extensive software development kit specifically tailored for the Raspberry Pi RP-family microcontrollers, notably powering the XIAO RP2350 board. It encompasses a broad array of libraries and tools designed to support the creation of sophisticated applications. This SDK caters to both novice enthusiasts and seasoned professionals aiming to exploit the robust capabilities of the RP2350 microcontroller in diverse projects.

## Prerequisite üìÉ

Prior to commencing the SDK Programming on XIAO RP2350, the following equipment are required:

- A USB Type-C cable.
- The XIAO RP2350 board.
- A personal computer equipped with a Linux/Unix operating system.

:::caution Attention

This documentation primarily addresses development under a Linux environment (Ubuntu 22.04). Windows users are directed to consult the following resource for compatible setup instructions: [Raspberry Pi Pico Setup on Windows](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows).

## Installation Guide ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

Execute the following commands on your Linux terminal to install the essential system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ git
```

### Step 2: üî® Toolchain Installation  {#install_gcc_arm}

To ensure that you can compile code for the RP2350, a specific toolchain is required. Below are two methods for installing the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain, which provides the necessary compilers and libraries for ARM architecture.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="manual_install" label="Option 1: Manual Installation" default>

The manual installation process allows precise control over the installation environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the Toolchain**:

Access the [ARM Developer Downloads](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm) page and download the `.tar.bz2` file for the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain.

2. **Extract the Archive**:

Once the download is complete, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file was saved. Execute the following command to extract the archive:

```shell
tar -xjf {downloaded-file}.tar.bz2
```

3. **Update System Path**:

To make the toolchain accessible from any terminal session, add its directory to your system's PATH. Input the following command in your terminal, substituting `{VERSION}` with the actual version number of the toolchain:

```shell
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

4. **Apply Configuration Changes**:

To ensure that the PATH update takes effect immediately, source your `.bashrc` file by running:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script_install" label="Option 2: Scripted Installation">

Opt for a scripted installation to simplify and automate the setup process. Execute the following steps:

1. **Download and Execute the Script**:
   Download the installation script using `curl` and set the necessary execution permissions:
   
   ```shell
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seeed-Projects/Seeed-xiao-rp2350-sdk/main/install_gcc_arm.sh
   chmod +x install_gcc_arm.sh
   ./install_gcc_arm.sh
   ```

<details><summary>View Script Code</summary>

The script automates the downloading, extraction, and PATH configuration processes. Here's the script content:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Automatically handle the download and installation of the gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain
TOOLCHAIN_URL="https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/{VERSION}/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}-linux.tar.bz2"
wget $TOOLCHAIN_URL -O toolchain.tar.bz2
tar -xjf toolchain.tar.bz2
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
rm toolchain.tar.bz2
```

### Step 3: ‚õìÔ∏è SDK Installation  {#install_sdk}

The Pico SDK is essential as it provides the libraries, examples, and documentation required to develop software for the RP2350. It abstracts much of the hardware complexity through easy-to-use APIs and is regularly updated to include support for new features and performance improvements.

#### Installation Instructions

To install the Pico SDK, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$(pwd)/pico-sdk" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

These commands clone the SDK from its repository, set the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable to its location, and update your shell configuration to include this path, ensuring the SDK is accessible in your development environment.

:::tip Enhanced Setup on Raspberry Pi 4B or Pi 400

If you are developing directly on a Raspberry Pi 4B or Raspberry Pi 400, you can streamline the installation process with a setup script that automates these steps:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh
chmod +x pico_setup.sh
./pico_setup.sh
```

This script configures your development environment specifically for the Pico on Raspberry Pi hardware, simplifying the initial setup and allowing you to focus on development.

#### Expanded SDK Download and Setup

<details><summary>Expand to view the detailed SDK setup script</summary>

For a more tailored SDK installation, especially if working with different shell environments, consider using the detailed setup script below:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Clone the appropriate Pico SDK repository
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git # should be pico-sdk-rp2350-a1
cd pico-sdk
PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/pico-sdk-rp2350-a1"

# Add the SDK path to your shell's configuration file
if [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
elif [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
else
    # For other shells, adjust accordingly
    SHELL_CONFIG_FILE="$(basename $SHELL)rc"
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/$SHELL_CONFIG_FILE
    source ~/$SHELL_CONFIG_FILE
fi

# Verify the environment variable setting
echo "PICO_SDK_PATH is set to ${PICO_SDK_PATH}"
```

This script ensures that the SDK path is correctly set up in your environment, regardless of the shell you use, and verifies that the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is correctly set.

## Exploring the Examples and Building Projects

For newcomers to SDK programming, a practical approach involves studying the code of pre-existing Pico examples. This provides valuable insight into coding conventions and methodologies employed within the SDK environment.

### Steps to Execute the Code

The following steps outline the process from setting up the development environment to running your code on the XIAO RP2350 board:

1. **Development Environment Setup**: Initiate by configuring your development environment. Detailed instructions can be found on the [Setting Up the Pico SDK](/xiao-rp2350-c-cpp-sdk) documentation page. This setup is essential for ensuring that all necessary tools and libraries are correctly installed and configured.

2. **Code Composition**: Utilize a preferred text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop your application. For an initial test, you may start by writing the sample `blink.c` program, which toggles the board's LED. Save this file within your project directory.

3. **Code Compilation**:
   To compile your program, the Pico SDK offers a suite of tools streamlined for this purpose. Execute the following sequence of commands in your terminal, ensuring you are in the project directory where `blink.c` is located:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   This process will generate a build environment, configure the project, and compile the source code into an executable format.

4. **Code Upload**:
   Upon successful compilation, a binary file with the `.uf2` extension is created in the `build` directory. This file must be transferred to the XIAO RP2350 board for execution. Connect the board via USB and copy the `.uf2` file to the device's mounted storage, typically appearing as a removable drive on your computer.

   After transferring the file, the XIAO RP2350 will automatically reboot, and you should observe the onboard LED blinking‚Äîindicating that the program is running effectively.

### Example 1: LED Blink

To demonstrate basic SDK usage, the following example details programming the onboard LED to blink:

```c title="blink.c"
#include "pico/stdlib.h"

const int sleep_time = 250;

int main() {
    const uint LED_PIN = PICO_DEFAULT_LED_PIN; // GPIO25
    gpio_init(LED_PIN);
    gpio_set_dir(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);
    while (true) {
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 1);
        sleep_ms(sleep_time);
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 0);
        sleep_ms(sleep_time);
    }
}
```
