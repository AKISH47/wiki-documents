## Different types of mmWave Radar Sensors


Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensors are capable of detecting objects, measuring their distance, speed, and angle, and can penetrate various materials such as plastic, clothing, and drywall, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
In Seeed, We have leveraged the power of mmWave to come up with various sensors that can perform a variety of actions, such as fall detection and sleep breathing monitoring.

Our range of mmWave Radar Sensors are shown below, each with different features and functions. Click on any of the products below to find out more about them!
