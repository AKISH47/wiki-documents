Single-channel gateways are low-cost tools that enable users to begin exploring the LoRa realm. These gateways can receive LoRa packets on a specific spreading factor and channel and facilitate the exchange of these packets with the network. Due to their affordability, many users have embarked on building their own single-channel gateways to experiment with LoRa.
The XIAO ESP32S3 as host MCU and Wio SX1262 LoRa radio kit can be configured to function as both a LoRa node and a gateway for connecting to The Things Network. This kit offers a practical solution for those interested in delving into LoRa technology and establishing connections to The Things Network.
