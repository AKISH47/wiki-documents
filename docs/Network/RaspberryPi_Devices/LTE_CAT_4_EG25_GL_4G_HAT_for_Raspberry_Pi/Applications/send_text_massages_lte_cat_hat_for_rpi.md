## Introduction 

In rural and remote areas, where 4G coverage is sparse or unavailable, SMS communication through 2G networks becomes a vital tool for ensuring uninterrupted connectivity in IoT systems. **For wildlife preservation, this technology enables automated alert systems to monitor environmental conditions, track animal movements, and report critical events in real-time**. By leveraging 4G modules with SMS capabilities, devices can send automated alerts and receive instructions, ensuring that even in isolated regions, conservation efforts are not hindered by lack of modern network infrastructure. This integration of automation and communication helps enhance the effectiveness of monitoring systems in remote wildlife areas, offering a reliable solution for protection and research.

## Sending an SMS Using QCOM Tool on Windows


### Step 1: Setup the Module

- **Plug in the Module**
    - Connect the module to your Windows PC via USB. Make sure the DIP switches are positioned in the correct order. In this case, all switches are set to 0, which means they are disabled.
- **Turn on the Module**
    - Press the power button on the module.
- **Verify Communication Ports**
    - [Ensure that the drivers are installed correctly](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_raspberry_pi_4g_lte_hat/#for-windows). You should see the COM ports listed in the Windows Device Manager.
